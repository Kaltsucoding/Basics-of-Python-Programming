Here is a Python-course team project that i did with three mates in last summer.  
Idea of the project was make an imaginary game where user can choose a path from three different options and then answer the questions with keyboard commands.  
My role was design a story behind the game and develope the Python code in collaboration with team members.  
The program is generally implemented by functions: Main code-file and sub-program-file.
